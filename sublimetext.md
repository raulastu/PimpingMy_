Sublime Text 2 and Command Line Integration
Posted May 8, 2012
A little background: Sublime Text 2 is the ultimate programmer's notepad (Thanks to Lan for introducing me this tool). I've been using it since last year especially when editing Grails applications and so far I'm loving it.

One thing that's lacking out of the box is the shell integration; a way to launch the command line and pass your project's folder path for convenience. Fortunately, there's a package for it. It's called Shell Turtlestein.

You can install Shell Turtlestein using Package Control. If you don't have Package Control yet, I highly suggest you install it.
When you have the Package Control, access it through Preferences menu > Package Control.
Select "Install Package" and search for Shell Turtlestein and select it.
After the package is installed, you can use ctrl + alt + shift + C (in Windows) to launch the command line.
You can also use ctrl + shift + C to prompt for a shell command.
